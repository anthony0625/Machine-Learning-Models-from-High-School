This repository contains what machine learning models I made during high school that I am still able to find. They were made primarily during my junior year and were more proof of concepts than actual applications. The ones made in C++ were made completely from scratch without the use of any supplementary libraries to demonstrate an understanding of the math involved in machine learning models while the ones made in tensorflow/openCV were done for a more efficient development cycle.
